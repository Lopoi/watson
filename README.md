# Watson
 
A simple interface for [sherlock-project/sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock)

![Example](https://github.com/lopoi/watson/blob/main/example.png?raw=true)

## Instalation

Just download the `.zip`, unpack all contents in a safe space and run the `.exe`.

I could upload a single `.exe` but it will just trigger anti-viruses. ~~If anyone knows how to fix that, feel free to~~

## Usage

After opening, just type in the name and begin te search.

**The Window will probably freeze while it's searching, it is a feature.**

Well, not really, but I couldn't find a way to fix that, so just be patient, nothing bad is happening ~~(I hope)~~

## Why did you make this?

Honestly, just cause I wanted to see if I could. My main goals with this was:

* Making a gui for shrlock without changing/copy pasting its code (thats why this use the module system from git, it's probably not the best, but I wanted to see how it would work)
* Learning more about non-web gui packages. Im primarily a web-dev, so I wanted to dip my toes in the frontend for non-web stuff and see how it is.
* To have fun

## What's next?

I have a few things I want to do with this ~~(for learning)~~:

- [ ] Add checkbox with the flag options.
- [ ] Make the output a bit prettier (maybe actually parse it?)
- [ ] Fix the lag (I dont think I can)
- [x] Eat cake

## Contributing

Go help the [sherlock project](https://github.com/sherlock-project), they did the hard work. But if you want to submit a fix to this package, feel free to, I will check when I have time.
